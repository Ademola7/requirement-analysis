Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on understanding and applying the process of Requirement Analysis within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It explains how software requirements are gathered, analyzed, documented, and validated to ensure that the final product meets the needs of both users and the business. The goal of this project is to help learners understand how to translate user needs into clear and structured requirements that guide successful software development.

What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most important stages in the SDLC. It involves identifying and defining what a software system should do and how it should perform. During this stage, project teams work closely with clients and users to understand their needs, expectations, and goals. The information gathered here forms the foundation for design, development, and testing.

In simple terms, this phase ensures that developers know exactly what to build and that stakeholders agree on what the final system should look like and how it should behave.

Importance of Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis helps create a clear path for software development by eliminating confusion and aligning everyone on the same vision. Some key reasons why it is important include:

Clarity and Alignment: Everyone involved understands the purpose, scope, and goals of the project.

Reduced Misunderstandings: Prevents costly errors and rework during later stages.

Defined Scope: Clearly outlines what the system will and won’t include.

Better Planning: Allows for more accurate cost, time, and resource estimates.

Quality Results: Ensures that the final software meets user expectations and works as intended.

When done properly, Requirement Analysis turns vague ideas into actionable and measurable plans that guide the entire project.

Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

Requirement Analysis involves a series of organized steps that help ensure every requirement is clear, complete, and testable.

1. Requirement Gathering:
This step involves collecting detailed information from stakeholders through methods like interviews, surveys, observation, and document analysis.

2. Requirement Elicitation:
Focuses on refining the gathered information and understanding what users truly need through brainstorming, focus groups, or prototyping.

3. Requirement Documentation:
All requirements are written down in a structured format such as a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document or user stories.

4. Requirement Modeling and Analysis:
Here, the collected requirements are analyzed and modeled using diagrams like Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) or Use Case Diagrams to visualize how the system will function.

5. Requirement Validation:
Finally, the documented requirements are reviewed to ensure they are correct, complete, and meet the needs of stakeholders. This step ensures the requirements are ready for the design phase.

Types of Requirements

Requirements are generally divided into two categories: Functional and Non-functional.

Functional Requirements
These describe what the system should do. For example, in a Booking Management System:

Users should be able to register and log in.

Users can search for properties by location, price, or availability.

The system should allow users to book and view their booking history.

Admins should be able to add or remove property listings.

Non-functional Requirements
These describe how the system should perform. They focus on performance, security, and reliability. For example:

The website should load within two seconds.

All user data should be encrypted for security.

The system should be scalable to handle many users.

The interface should be easy to use across different devices.

Both types of requirements are equally important in ensuring that the software is not only functional but also reliable, efficient, and user-friendly.

Use Case Diagrams

What are Use Case Diagrams?
Use Case Diagrams show how users (actors) interact with a system to achieve specific goals. They help teams visualize the main functions of a system and understand what actions users can perform.

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

They make it easier to understand how the system works from the user’s perspective.

They improve communication between team members and stakeholders.

They help identify all the roles that interact with the system.

They serve as a guide during design and testing phases.

Example: Booking System Use Case Diagram
Below is a diagram showing the main users and interactions in a Booking Management System.

Actors:

Guest – Can browse and search for properties.

Registered User – Can book, view, and manage bookings.

Admin – Manages listings and user activities.

Use Cases:

Search for properties

View property details

Register / Login

Book property

Manage bookings

Add or remove listings (Admin)

Approve or cancel bookings (Admin)

Acceptance Criteria

What is Acceptance Criteria?
Acceptance Criteria are the specific conditions that a feature must meet before it can be accepted by the product owner or stakeholders. It helps the team know when a feature is done and working as expected.

Why Acceptance Criteria is Important:

It provides clarity on what success looks like for each feature.

It helps in quality assurance and testing.

It reduces misunderstandings about requirements.

It ensures accountability and progress tracking.

Example: Checkout Feature

User Story:
As a registered user, I want to complete my booking and payment online so that I can confirm my reservation instantly.

Acceptance Criteria:

Users should see a summary of their booking before payment.

The system must support multiple payment options.

Payment must be secure and encrypted.

A confirmation message and email should be sent after payment.

The system should prevent duplicate payments.

Failed payments should show an error message.

All transactions must be recorded for auditing.

Summary

Requirement Analysis helps teams turn ideas into structured and testable plans. It forms the basis for all later stages of development — from design to testing — and ensures that the final product meets the needs of both users and the business.
